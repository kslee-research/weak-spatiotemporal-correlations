# weak-spatiotemporal-correlations

## Overview

This repository contains analysis code and processed data associated with a study on weak but reproducible spatiotemporal correlation structures extracted from noisy optical measurements around a spherical object.

The focus of this work is on phenomenological characterization and statistical analysis rather than on definitive theoretical attribution. The repository is intended to support transparency and reproducibility of the reported results.
